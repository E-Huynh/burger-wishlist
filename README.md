## Project Description
This app allows a user to track burger that they wish to devour. A user can type in any burger they wish to add it to the list. When they have eaten the burger it can be sent to the devoured list by clicking the devour button. 
## Functionality
A user can type a burger name into the input box and click add. The burger name will be added the database and displayed in the "Burgers to Devour" list. Whenever a user is ready to move the burger to the "Burgers Devoured" list, they can simply click the devour button, allowing a user to track their burgers.

The most challenging part of this project was setting up the file structure for the MVC and ensureing everything was connected properly. It really help to cement what each file was contributing and how they all linked together.
